### What is this document about?
This FAQ is primarily addressed at validators and those interested in the launch process. It addresses different questions related to the protocol, economics, incentives, etc. I have tried to keep the answers as short as possible. Please make sure to check out links provided throughout the FAQ for more details on each topic. 

### What is Cyber?
Cyber is a computer for answers in its most simple form. But that description doesn't shed any light on what this computer can do exactly. Well, for starters it should be mentioned, that cyber is build with the help of go-IPFS and cosmos-SDK. It is a brand new and a unique take on search mechanisms and the creation of knowledge databases.

Cyber can be described as an inter-planetary search engine that introduces a protocol for provable communication between consensus computers of relevance. This means that cyber helps to provide what is relevant - from one machine to another. Cyber achieves this by using knowledge graphs, consensus mechanisms, economical incentives and several newly created applications on top of it. 

Cyber is based on a simple idea of content defined knowledge graphs generated by web3-agents via the use of cyberlinks (a link between 2 IPFS hashes) - a simple, yet a powerful semantic construction for building a predictive model of the universe (please check out this [use-cases file](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/usecases.md) to see more possible use-cases). Along with the free will of the agents projected in the form of economic incentives, this helps to generate a real-time, accessible and a relevant database of knowledge that can be both - built and queried by any kind of intelligence (that can prove communication ability via the use of its private key). 

It is more than a simple search engine. It resembles a brain, with endless neurotransmitters, neurons, knowledge and constant signalling of information in the form of transactions based upon any lack of censorship. 

### What are Cyb and cyb~Virus?
Cyb is a web3 browser built from scratch. It is your personal and customizable search application, on top of the Cyber protocol. Cyb is a friendly, personal robot that can be your guide in the digital realm.  
[The latest release can be found here](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyb/releases).

cyb~Virus is a chrome extension that allows anyone to pin any web page to IPFS with just one click and index it by any keywords, hence, making it searchable. cyb_virus is also a fully functioning blockchain wallet app on top of Cyber. This means that you can store and transact token with its help. 
[The latest release of cyb~Virus can be obtained here](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyb-virus/releases) or via Chrome extensions.

### What is cyber~Page?
[cyber~Page](https://cyber.page/#/) is the main interface of the ecosystem, accessible via any web2 browser. It has search functionality (simply enter a keyword and it will link you to the coordinating IPFS hash if it exists, of course), distribution games and will contain other essentials (governance-related, user abilities for example).

### What are THC and CYB?
THC and CYB are the two "native" tokens of the ecosystem (in the future other developers may build on top of cyber, hence they might create more tokens). 

THC is an Ethereum based ERC-20 token that has utility value in the form of control over cyber~ Foundation and the ETH from the distribution games. It is a governance token. The creative powers of THC come from the ability to receive 1 CYB token per each (one) THC token when locking it before the end of cyber~Auction.

CYB is a native token of the sovereign cyber protocol powered by the Tendermint consensus algorithm. It has 3 primary uses: (1) staking for consensus, (2) bandwidth limiting for submitting cyberlinks, and (3) expression of will for the computing of cyber~rank by the agents.

### What is cyber~Foundation?
cyber ~Foundation is a sovereign entity deployed by cyber ~Congress. The initial intentions of cyber ~Congress can be found in [this document](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/README.md). 

The role of cyber ~Foundation is to help the community govern the protocol via an Aragon DAO. It is a fund managed via a decentralized engine, charged with the donated ETH and managed by the community (agents of the protocol). It is also responsible for organising the Game of links and the minting of THC tokens. It should be noted that burn and mint rights must (and will) be revoked after allocation of the tokens.  

### What other entities are there?
cyber~ Congress, which is a sovereign entity that helps to launch the protocol, commits to the code base, helps to gather the initial community, write the initial documentation, organise the distribution and deploy the Genesis. Its intentions can be found in the link to the document above. The Congress lives in Ethereum, as an [Aragon DAO](https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/cybercongress/0x4feb2bcc5907e7779130c093eef8fb44502c1330). cyber~ Congress is entitled to receive 10% of THC tokens for its work (which it will stake to receive CYB tokens). Our target is to wash down this share by 5 in the next 15 years. Out of its share cyber~Congress is allocating 3% to another entity, that will help to develop the ecosystem: cyber ~Ecosystem. 

Its intentions and goals, can be found in [this docuemnt](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/cyber~Ecosystem%20development%20paper.md). Its main goal is to help grow the protocol and the innovation around it.

### What are the distribution games?
There are 3 distribution games proposed in total. Their goal is to help increase the initial efficiency of the distribution. 

- The Game of links is focused on the early believers in the protocol and the initial validator set. 100 TCYB is allocated for this game, to each of the participating communities. It is launched at the same time that Euler-5 is launched. The main idea of the Game of Links is to establish a starting value of relevance in the knowledge graph because it is crucial to get quality search results from the inception of the network. The game will be finished when either 600 thousand ATOMs are collected or 90 days have passed from the start of the funding (there will probably be a prolongation for an N period to have a grand finale of the game).
There are 4 major disciplines in which participants can compete (a) lifetime of a validator - the longer the validator is run for, the better; (b) delegations to a validator - the more a validator is delegated, the better; (c) bandwidth and load - the more someone spends the better; and, finally (d) relevance - this is projected in terms of the top 1000 CID's and links to those. The idea is to find the most relevant content or CID's.
Tokens for the game can be obtained either from EULER-4 rewards, from gifts or from test auctions.
Any other information can be found [in the provision file](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/pull/240/files) and [in the launch-kit repo](https://github.com/cybercongress/launch-kit).

- The game of Thrones will begin after the Genesis. It is an auction that is primarily focused on speculators (GoT represents window 0 of cyber~Auction).  10% of CYB supply is allocated per each competing community. 100TCYB to the ATOM community for donating ETH. And an equivalent amount to the ETH community, which will initially receive THC tokens that they can lock during the auction in exchange for CYB tokens (in other words the ETH donators can potentially receive both THC and CYB tokens). The game will last for 21 days.  
In other words, it's a game where one community of hodlers tries to outbid the other in return for receiving a larger discount. We have added an arbitrage opportunity in the form of a discount for ATOM holders during the game (this is because the market cap of ATOM is smaller than the market cap of ETH). Distribution of tokens will happen after the end of the game is announced.  

The third game is called cyber~Auction.

### What is cyber~Auction?
cyber ~Auction is part of the initial distribution games. If the first two focus on specific target groups (although anyone is free to participate). The goal of cyber ~Auction is to focus on all web3 agents. It will take place after the end of the previous games. 

cyber~ Auctions main purpose is the value of relevance or in other words - gain access to the donated ETH from the auction itself. The auction will last for 500 rounds that last for 23 hours each (a little over 479 days). Every round has 1 billion THC is at skate. The more you donate and the less has been donated by others on that same day the more you can gain.

After the end of the distribution, participants will be able to unlock their THC tokens and use them as they wish, e.i. transfer, trade, etc. As a result of the auction, the community will have access to all the donated ETH within the Aragon organization.  

One more mega important part of the auction to remember, are the creative powers of THC. If you vest your THC tokens for the period of the auction - you receive 1 CYB token for each locked THC token for the duration of the auction!

After the end of cyber~ Auction, all the remaining THC tokens on the contract and the equivalent in CYB tokens will be provably burned. 

### Who and why do you gift?
We are gifting 3 communities. Those are: 
- ETH community which will receive a drop of 8% of CYB tokens 
Every account within the Ethereum foundation network with at least 1 outgoing transaction which is not a contract and holds > 0.2 ETH at block 8080808 is entitled to a gift

- ATOM community that will receive 1% of CYB tokens
Every non-zero account within Cosmos hub-2 at block 1110000 is entitled to a gift

- Urbit community that will receive 1% of CYB tokens 
Every account which holds galaxies (30%), stars (30%), or planets (40%) at block 9069000 according to the number of objects is entitled to a gift

The key purpose of those gifts is for every account in Genesis to be able to make at least 1 cyberlink in the space of 24 hours after the network has been unloaded. This will help to increase participation and give those communities the ability to engage in the protocol. The protocol itself will gain a massive benefit via the economic integration of the largest developers, the most innovative and of the most promising communities withing the open-source space. 

The ETH and ATOM communities will receive their tokens in test net tokens, which should be claimed and used during the distribution games.

More detail applies to gifts. Please see the [protocol paper](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyber/blob/master/main.tex).

### What is the reward breakdown (including validators, community pools and gifts)?
You can see all the breakdowns in this repository (the launch-kit repository). 

There are 700 TTHC tokens (Terabytes are 12 zeros). They are broken down as per follows:
- 71.4% are for cyber~Auction
- 14.3% are for GoT
- 14.3% is allocated to cyber~Congress

There are 1PTCYB (a petabyte is 15 zeros). They are broken down per following:
- 90% for the distribution games (in other words open-sale) and for those who stake THC tokens (including cyber~Congress)
- 10% is a gift to Urbit, Cosmos and ETH communities

A further breakdown is available in the [white paper](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyber/blob/master/main.tex).

A complete breakdown of THC and CYB by category can be viewed in the [launch-kit readme file](https://github.com/cybercongress/launch-kit#distribution-params).

### How is rank calculated?
There is a formula and an extended explanation in our white paper. The short answer is: the calculation of the rank is dependent on its weight (the number of tokens it was linked with), the incoming and outgoing weight of the links and the load of the network. 
This makes the rank a dynamic property. 

### Why do you use CUDA cards?
There are two reasons:
- It allows us to quickly compute the rank, which would be impossible with the use of a CPU 
- The use of computational resources to build semantics allows for much more complex matrices, which leads to an increase in capabilities and opportunities of what can be done with those semantics. 

### Where can I find the current net version?
The current net version should always (and only) be checked on GitHub. In the [releases section](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyberd/releases).

### Where can I find an active list of seed-nodes?
Due to testing, the list is constantly being changed and updated. The latest list can be [found here](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyberd/issues/319). Please make sure that those nodes are functioning.

### What incentives are there to run a validator on cyber?
There are several reasons to run a validator node on top of Cyber:
- You will be receiving rewards for running a validator, just like in Cosmos (ATOM)
- You will be able to participate in the distribution games that lead to more rewards
- You can make use of your computation to take part in computing the knowledge graph and be a part of an exceptional project
- You can take part in forming the foundation of the knowledge graph for the new Great Web
- You will be eligible to build your reputation in the system and can participate in governance during the mainnet
- You can receive a commission from delegators on the mainnet
- You can become a web3 provider, buidl crazy things ([please see our apps section in the protocol] paper(https://github.com/cybercongress/cyber/blob/master/main.tex) for examples) and monetize those services in the future
- You will become part of the Cosmic community and with the launch of IBC and its development, you will (probably) be able to participate as a validator on other inter-connected chains

Please also check out this document explaining the [economy of the protocol](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/drafts/economic/economic_of_cyber.md).

### What do I (currently) require to run a validator node?
In theory, if you are already using an instance with similar GPU's you might be able to run a validator node. But, to stay "true" to the cause, we recommend using the following specs:

- CPU: 4 cores (6 is better)
- RAM: 16 GB (64 would be better)
- SSD: 256 GB (512 is preferred)
- Connection: 100 Mbit fiber
- GPU: CUDA / GeForce 1070/80
- Software: Linux, Docker

On our website, you can find a very [throughout guide](https://cybercongress.ai/docs/cyberd/run_validator/) on how to start your validator node. 
Please make sure the guide refers to the latest stable release.

### How many validators are there?
Cyberd has 146 validators who are responsible for proposing new blocks and validating transactions. This number will remain constant until it is ready to be increased or decreased via a governance proposal.

As the number of validators grows, then the right to participate in the consensus will see participants with a higher amount of CYB tokens bonded. This means more competition between validators. 

### What is expected from validators?
The primary responsibility of validators is the continuous ranking and recalculation of the knowledge graph.

Validators of Cyber also have the highest impact on network security. They should actively participate in governance and are expected to vote on every proposal. As validators can receive delegations, they should act in the interest of their delegators if they want to keep them loyal and increase their voting power in the long term. 
The more at stake - the higher might be the returns. 

### Are there any incentives for users?
Yes, there are currently several straight-forward incentives:
- Delegators are eligible to inflationary rewards, but they have to pay commission to validators (if such is set by a validator), which varies amongst existing validators
- To understand the true values of CYB tokens to users, one must understand that the users are the consumers and the service providers. Developers, entrepreneurs, SEO, buyers, and searchers simultaneously! Essentially, this means that users can build their own knowledge graphs, influence search results, build applications and monetize them. 
- Cyber provides an opportunity for content and browsing without censorship, advertisement, data re-selling. Completely customizable and personified browsing experience, solely to you.   

### Are there any transactional costs?
Not in its "regular" form. Cyber has declined transactional or message fees in favour of resource credits as a method of decreasing network load. Resource credits are a synonym for bandwidth in Cyber. They are dependent on the stake and the network load and can regenerate its powers over a period of 24 hours. 

The more RC (resource credits) the more transactions one can make. The more bandwidth points, the more opportunities. 

### Is inflation endless?
Unlike in Cosmos, the inflation in cyberd constantly strives to ~7%. This is achieved by tuning the `TokensPerBlock` parameter during the genesis setup. Given that the network has 1-second target block time and ~7% target inflation the starting parameter will be 50 MCYB (mega CYB).

### What are MCYB / GCYB / PCYB, etc?
Those are representations of the amounts of CYB tokens in megabytes, gigabytes, terabytes, petabytes, etc. I.E. 1GCYB of tokens is 1 Giga (byte) CYB of tokens or 1 with 9 zeros, which equals to 1 billion.
`1GCYB = 1000000000 CYB`

### How many tokens are there?
1PCYB of tokens. That's a lot, we know. 

### How can I contribute?
Depending on what you do, there are several ways to contribute:
- You can help by solving issues / submitting PR (booth technical and non-technical)
- You can help our [research](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/tree/master/research)
- You can spread the word about Cyber on social networks, to your friends, on the internet or in any other possible way 

### Will I be rewarded for my contributions?
There are several ways someone can get rewarded:
- We actively use [GitCoin](https://gitcoin.co/cybercongress/active). This means that we fund some of our tasks and issues. If you are an open-source developer, you can solve issues and get rewarded
- We constantly announce grants for open-source development and research. For example our [Urbit open-source proposal](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/communities/urbit/urbit.md)
- You can gain social weight and social reputation by becoming an early adopter (please make conclusions for yourself, as to what this might gain) 
- If you run a validator node, you are entitled to receive rewards that are described above

### What and how can I test already?
Right now you can help by testing the latest running release or/and any of our applications (please see all the VIP links at the end of this document).

### When is the launch?
For now, cyber is still in the test net zone. Meaning, that you can already help to validate the chain, test it, be entitled to receive rewards, etc. 

The launch is planned after the end of testing Euler-5 (unless any major issues arise).  Bear in mind, that having a set of 146 active validators in consensus is one of the conditions for Genesis to happen.

### How can I contact you?
Our main form of contact is via [GitHub](https://github.com/cybercongress) issues and pull requests. You may also contact us on our TG [#fuckGoogle](https://t.me/fuckgoogle) channel or via our [forum](https://ai.cybercongress.ai/).
